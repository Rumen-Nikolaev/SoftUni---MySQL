## Grouping
### Consolidating Data Based On Criteria
Grouping allows taking data into separate groups based on a common property.

**Example: Employees Table**
| Employee | Department        | Salary |
|----------|-------------------|--------|
| Adam     | Database Support   | 5,000  |
| John     | Database Support   | 15,000 |
| Jane     | Application Support| 10,000 |
| George   | Application Support| 15,000 |
| Lila     | Application Support| 5,000  |
| Fred     | Software Support   | 15,000 |

### GROUP BY
With `GROUP BY`, you can get each separate group and use an aggregate function over it (like Average, Min, or Max):

```sql
SELECT e.`job_title`, COUNT(employee_id)
FROM `employees` AS e
GROUP BY e.`job_title`;
